still need to edit cbase to run with new alignment
so currently saved cbase gene data with gene name from ensembl data
but mut targets is cactus data with gene ids 

idea is to only once extract and reverse complement seqs, then apply muts to pkl dicts
containing gene, seq, trinucs
muts positions in targets are saved relative to the start of the gene seq in pkl dicts

so for ever run create a new pkl dict, then from new pkl dict can calculate new target size easily
(just see run section in mutationmatrix generator after have seq and trinucs per gene)
